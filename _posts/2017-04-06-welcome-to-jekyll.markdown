## Prototype Design
- **GaitKeep** is a wearable necklace with a built-in speaker that plays calibrated rhythmic audio based on the user's walking cadence.
- A mobile app was developed to **calibrate** the necklace by identifying the user's natural walking cadence through a short **100-step walking test**.

## Data Collection & Algorithm
- **MATLAB** was used to collect accelerometer data from the user's phone to determine their optimal walking cadence.
- A **Python BPM algorithm** and **discrete wavelength transform** were applied to match **music** with the userâ€™s walking cadence, delivering the auditory stimulus needed to stabilize gait.

## Competition Results
- The project was well-received at the **University of Toronto CUBE Biomedical Engineering Competition**, where it earned **3rd place**.

## Key Features
- Integration of **wearable technology** with real-time feedback.
- Use of **MATLAB** for cadence analysis and **Python** for audio synchronization.
- **Mobile app** that personalizes cadence and plays music tailored to individual users.
