### Overview

Developed an autonomous mini-car capable of line-following and obstacle avoidance using infrared (IR) and ultrasonic sensors. The car employs a "Fancy Bang-Bang" control algorithm for smooth navigation, overcoming motor limitations for precise control.

### Key Features

- **Line Following:** Utilized IR sensors to detect the track and applied the "Fancy Bang-Bang" algorithm to adjust motor speeds for smooth turns and transitions.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Incorporated ultrasonic sensors with a servo motor to detect objects in the path and autonomously navigate around them.
- **C++ Implementation:** Wrote modular, efficient C++ code to integrate both the line-following and obstacle-avoidance features seamlessly.

### How It Works

1. **Sensor Integration:** The IR sensors track the line on the ground, while the ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles ahead, providing a real-time "point cloud" for navigation.

2. **Control Algorithm:** The "Fancy Bang-Bang" algorithm adjusts motor speeds based on sensor inputs, allowing the car to navigate tight turns while avoiding obstacles.
3. **Testing & Optimization:** Conducted thorough testing to minimize motor oscillations and fine-tune the system for real-world performance.

### Technical Overview

1. **Sensor Polling:**  
   The system continuously polls the IR and ultrasonic sensors, collecting measurements for line checkpoints and object distance.

2. **Control Input Computation:**  
   Based on the current and historical measurements from the IR sensors, the system computes the control input needed for accurate line-following.

3. **Object Detection and Avoidance:**  
   Using distance measurements from the ultrasonic sensor, the system determines if an object is detected and initiates object avoidance routines if necessary.

4. **Surroundings Scan:**  
   The system scans its surroundings by gathering 20+ floating-point measurements. The exact number depends on the required precision for the environment.

5. **Steering Decision:**  
   By analyzing the difference between the two IR sensor readings, the system decides whether to steer right or left to stay on track.

6. **Motor and Servo Control:**  
   Control inputs are then sent to the servo and motors to adjust the vehicleâ€™s movement according to the computed decisions.
